      in Rotaract. The Rotaract Club of VIT Chennai was very happy to take part in such a project. The speakers delivered series of talks to the Green Rotaractors encouraging them to actively participate in the club events and to pitch in new ideas

      <h3>VIRTUAL MOVIE NIGHT</h3>
      <br>
      On the 27th of August 2021, our Club Service Team planned for a Virtual Movie Night. We asked the members to choose a movie of their interest. We consolidated their opinions with the help of Google forms and finalized to screen the movie named
      BURIED starring Ryan Reynolds. Screening of the movie started at 9:50 PM with 30 participants. It is a thriller movie and it kept all of us on the edge of our seats for the entire 90 minutes.
      <br><br>
      It was worth watching and people enjoyed the movie. We finished screening around 10:25 PM with 40 members in the meet. Then we had a general discussion on how the movie went and got certain honest reviews about the movie from the participants.
      We winded off the meet at 10:40 PM.

      <h3>FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION <br>AWARENESS WEBINAR</h3>
      <br>
      An awareness webinar about "Female Genital Mutilation" was organized by the Rotaract Club of VIT Chennai. The event was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Chennai spotlight. This event was held to create awareness about female genital cutting and
      what can we do to stop this practice.
      <br><br>
      Female Genital Mutilation comprises all procedures involving the removal of the external female genitalia or other injuries to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Most often, FGM is practised on girls and young women under 18.
      FGM is not prescribed by any religion and has no health benefits. On the contrary, the practice can cause life-lasting physical and psychological trauma.

      <h3>AMUDHASURABHI FOOD DONATION</h3>
      <br>
      Donating to the needy is a great way to improve the conditions in our neighbourhood or community. Donating food to needy people helps counter poverty, and hunger and at the same time, it can improve harmony, friendliness, and trust among
      residents.
      <br><br>
      We started the first phase of our Food Donation project - Amudhasurabhi on 25th September 2021. We planned to donate food and water bottle to the needy. Since it is a COVID-19 situation we also included mask donation in the event. So we donated
      food, water bottle, and mask for the needy in and around the areas of Villivakkam and Kolathur. Due to the pandemic, even though we couldn't gather all the members of the club, a few of us joined and contributed Rs.1000 and donated the food,
      water bottle, and mask for 25 people in places like temples, churches, mosques, buses terminus and the subway. We started this drive successfully in September. Hope our aim to fill the stomach of poor people was accomplished and continue every
      month without any hurdle.

      <h3>9 FACTS ABOUT THE NUMBER 9 <br>PROMOTIONAL EVENT</h3>
      <br>
      Fact is something that is true. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability, that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience.
      <br><br>
      The word "fact" has at least one meaning within our language and other languages could have equivalent words that refer to the same concept. We can better understand the concept of "facts" by studying language, considering how the word should be used, and realizing that there are common confusions involving the word.
      <br><br>
      Project 9 Facts about the number 9 was conducted to throw some interesting and fun facts about the number 9. It is a promotional event for Group 9.
